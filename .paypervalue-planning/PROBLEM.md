# Problem Statement

## The Problem
**AI agents are paid for compute, not value.**

Today businesses pay for AI by: token count, API calls, compute hours.
No one knows what AI is actually worth.

## Impact
- **Consumers** - Overpaying without ROI visibility
- **B2B Platforms** - Can't justify AI costs
- **Agent Developers** - No standard for pricing
- **Enterprises** - Black hole in AI spending

## Root Cause
The market measures AI by inputs (tokens), not outputs (outcomes).

## Opportunity
Build the pricing infrastructure for the AI economy.
Become the Bloomberg of AI valuation.
