# GSD Framework - Get Shit Done

## Core Philosophy
> "Perfect is the enemy of done. Ship early, iterate fast."

## The 5 GSD Laws
1. **Law of Immediate Action** - Every problem has an action
2. **Law of Minimal Viable** - Smallest solution IS the solution
3. **Law of Relentless Prioritization** - Only one thing is #1
4. **Law of Blocker Elimination** - Remove obstacles first
5. **Law of Ship Date** - The date is a promise

## GSD Workflow
PROBLEM → SOLUTION → ACTION → SHIP → MEASURE → ITERATE
