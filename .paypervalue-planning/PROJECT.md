# PROJECT.md - PayPerValue

## What We're Building
AI Agent Valuation & Marketplace Platform

## The Problem
AI agents are paid for compute, not value. No standard for outcome-based pricing.

## The Solution
A platform that:
1. Analyzes AI deliverables and provides fair pricing recommendations
2. Benchmarks AI agents by ROI and outcomes
3. Enables B2B platforms to adopt outcome-based pricing

## Target Users
- **Consumers** - Understanding AI value before purchasing
- **B2B Platforms** - Justifying AI costs to leadership
- **Agent Developers** - Pricing their AI work fairly

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript, React, Vite
- Google AI Studio (Gemini API)
- Tailwind CSS (UI)

## Constraints
- MVP ship by 2026-02-10
- Solo developer (Mike)
- No enterprise overhead
